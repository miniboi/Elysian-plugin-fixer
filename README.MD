Made for ElysianGaming's Garry's mod server, when the plugins let you down, just use this tool to repair them!

Usage:
1. Type in Steam's path in the program files (for example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam or C:\Program Files\Steam). You can use the Browse-button to browse to the path.
2. Press "Fix" and wait for the progressbar to finnish. When the progresslabel say's "Done!" you are ready to go!

Note: Make sure that Garry's mod and Steam (yes, even in the task manager) is closed before you are trying to fix the files!
